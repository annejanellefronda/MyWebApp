# This lab exercise is Firebase Web Application Deployment. In this activity, we learned to create a Firebase project - creating a simple HTML signup and login page, and began to learn and started navigating the Firebase Console, preparing the project, checking enabled authentication and building a Firebase Database, and eventually running and deploying the web app with Firebase hosting. 
# We have also witnessed how the Firebase database work with our web application's program despite separate devices/login throught the Project's Web App configuration code.
